# Common home-manager modules

This directory contains home-manager modules that I would expect to be on any machine whether it has a desktop environment or not.

This will contain all tools used in a terminal as well as the base home-manager config.

## Goals

* [ ] Neovim config in a decent state for development
* [ ] tmux configurations
* [ ] Commonly installed programs and scripts that I use
